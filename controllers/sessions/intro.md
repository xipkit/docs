# Session Overview

Sessions in Xip allow your bot to maintain a "conversation" with its users. If you come from the web development world, they are very similar to HTTP sessions. If you don't come from that world, no worries, we'll explain how sessions work without needing to know. If you haven't yet read the primer on [Flows and States](../../flows/overview.md), we recommend you do that first.
