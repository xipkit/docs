# Getting Started

Xip is designed to run on Ruby \(MRI\) 2.5+

While we don't require any C-based Ruby gems, we haven't yet certified Xip on other VMs \(such as JRuby\). However, we do intend to provide official support for JRuby and TruffleRuby soon.

### Installation

You can install Stealth via RubyGems:

```ruby
gem install xip
```

Next, create your new bot:

```text
xip new <bot_name>
```
